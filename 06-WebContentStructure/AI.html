        <h1>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>
        <class name="AI Definition">
            <h2>AI Definition</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development
                of computer systems that can perform tasks typically
                requiring human intelligence. These tasks include
                problem-solving, understanding natural language,
                recognizing patterns, and making decisions.</p>
            <img src="AI.png" alt="AI">
            <p>AI is a broad field that encompasses various subfields
                and techniques, such as machine learning, natural
                language processing, robotics, and computer vision.</p>

        <class  name="Key Concepts in AI">
            <h2>Key Concepts in AI</h2>
            <p>In relation to artificial intelligence,
                the following key concepts can be distinguished:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI
                    that allows systems to learn from data and improve
                    over time without being explicitly programmed.
                    Examples include recommendation systems (like
                    Netflix or YouTube) and fraud detection.</li>
                <li>Natural Language Processing (NLP): A branch of AI
                    focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret,
                    and generate human language. Applications include voice
                    assistants like Siri or Alexa, chatbots, and language
                    translation systems.</li>
                <li>Computer Vision: Enables machines to interpret
                    and make decisions based on visual data from the world,
                    such as images and videos. It's widely used in facial
                    recognition, self-driving cars, and medical imaging.</li>
                <li>Robotics: AI powers robots, giving them the ability
                    to perform tasks autonomously, often in environments
                    that are too dangerous or complex for humans.</li>
                <li>Expert Systems: AI-based systems designed to mimic
                    human expertise in specific domains, such as medical
                    diagnosis or financial decision-making.</li>
            </ol>
        </class>
        <class name="Examples of AI in Daily Life">
            <h2>Examples of AI in Daily Life</h2>
            <p>AI is used as voice assistants. Siri, Google Assistant,
                and Alexa use AI to understand and respond to voice
                commands. Platforms like Netflix and Amazon use AI to
                recommend products or shows based on your previous
                interactions. AI enables self-driving cars to navigate
                roads and make driving decisions.</p>
            <p>The data in the table shows four main areas of AI application:
                natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning,
                and reinforcement learning. Each area is related to a specific application,
                such as chatbots, medical image analysis systems, or autonomous vehicles.
                These applications have a significant impact on various sectors,
                improving the efficiency of customer service, medical diagnostics,
                protection against financial fraud, and the development of modern
                technologies such as self-driving cars.</p>
